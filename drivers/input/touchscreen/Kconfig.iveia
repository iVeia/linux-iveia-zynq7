 	  Say Y here if you have a touchscreen interface using an
 	  Amel maXTouch controller, and your board-specific initialization
 	  code includes that in its table of I2C devices.
 
 	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").
 
 	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
 	  module will be called maXTouch.
